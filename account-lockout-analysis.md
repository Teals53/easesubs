# Account Lockout Functionality Analysis

## Overview
This document analyzes the current account lockout implementation in the EaseSubs application to verify if it's working correctly and identify potential issues.

## Current Implementation Summary

### ‚úÖ What's Working
1. **Basic Account Locking Logic** (`src/lib/auth.ts`)
   - Failed login attempts are tracked in memory using a Map
   - Account locks after 5 failed attempts within 15 minutes
   - Lockout duration is 15 minutes
   - Successful login clears failed attempts

2. **Security Monitoring Integration**
   - Security events are logged for suspicious activities
   - BRUTE_FORCE_ATTEMPT events logged with escalating severity
   - CRITICAL events logged when account is locked

3. **Database Schema Support**
   - `SecurityEvent` table exists for logging security events
   - `BlockedIP` table exists for IP-based blocking
   - Proper indexes for performance

4. **Authentication Flow**
   - `isAccountLocked()` check before credential validation
   - `recordFailedLogin()` called on authentication failures
   - `clearFailedAttempts()` called on successful login

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issues Identified

#### 1. **Memory-Based Storage (Critical)**
```typescript
// In src/lib/auth.ts:9-12
const failedAttempts = new Map<
  string,
  { count: number; lastAttempt: number; lockedUntil?: number }
>();
```
**Problems:**
- Data lost on server restart
- Won't work in multi-server/serverless environments
- No persistence across deployments
- Scaling issues with multiple instances

**Impact:** High - Account lockouts may not persist, reducing security effectiveness

#### 2. **No User Feedback for Locked Accounts**
```typescript
// In src/app/auth/signin/signin-form.tsx:36-41
if (result?.error) {
  // Generic error message to prevent user enumeration
  setError("Invalid email or password");
  setIsLoading(false);
  return;
}
```
**Problems:**
- Users don't know their account is locked
- No indication of lockout duration
- Poor user experience
- May lead to continued failed attempts

**Impact:** Medium - User confusion, support tickets

#### 3. **Silent Failures in Security Monitoring**
```typescript
// In src/lib/auth.ts (multiple locations)
} catch {
  await recordFailedLogin(email);
  return null;
}
```
**Problems:**
- Database errors don't prevent authentication
- Security events may not be logged properly
- No alerting on security monitor failures

**Impact:** Medium - Security events may be lost

#### 4. **Time Window Logic Edge Case**
```typescript
// In src/lib/auth.ts:25-27
if (now - attempts.lastAttempt > LOCKOUT_CONFIG.attemptWindow) {
  attempts.count = 0;
}
```
**Potential Issue:**
- Rapid attempts just before window expiry could reset counter
- Edge case: attempt at 14:59, then at 15:01 resets count

**Impact:** Low - Minor security gap

### üîß Recommended Fixes

#### 1. **Implement Database-Persistent Lockouts**
```typescript
// New model needed in schema.prisma
model AccountLockout {
  id          String    @id @default(cuid())
  email       String    @unique
  attempts    Int       @default(0)
  lastAttempt DateTime
  lockedUntil DateTime?
  createdAt   DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime  @updatedAt

  @@index([email])
  @@index([lockedUntil])
}
```

#### 2. **Add User-Friendly Lockout Messages**
```typescript
// Enhanced error handling in signin-form.tsx
if (result?.error === 'AccountLocked') {
  setError("Account temporarily locked due to multiple failed attempts. Please try again in 15 minutes.");
} else if (result?.error) {
  setError("Invalid email or password");
}
```

#### 3. **Add Administrative Override**
```typescript
// Add to security-monitor.ts
async unlockAccount(email: string, adminUserId: string): Promise<void> {
  // Clear lockout and log admin action
}
```

### üß™ Testing Plan

#### Automated Tests Needed
1. **Unit Tests for Lockout Logic**
   - Test lockout after 5 attempts
   - Test time window reset
   - Test successful login clearing attempts

2. **Integration Tests**
   - End-to-end authentication flow
   - Security event logging verification
   - Database persistence (when implemented)

3. **Load Testing**
   - Multiple concurrent failed attempts
   - Memory usage under load
   - Performance impact assessment

#### Manual Testing Steps
1. Use the provided `test-account-lockout.js` script
2. Verify security events in database
3. Test lockout expiration
4. Verify successful login clears lockout

### üìä Current Security Configuration

| Setting | Value | Recommendation |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| Max Failed Attempts | 5 | ‚úÖ Appropriate |
| Lockout Duration | 15 minutes | ‚úÖ Reasonable |
| Attempt Window | 15 minutes | ‚úÖ Good |
| Storage | In-memory Map | ‚ùå Change to database |
| User Feedback | Generic error | ‚ùå Add specific lockout message |

### üéØ Immediate Actions Required

1. **High Priority**
   - [ ] Run the test script to verify current functionality
   - [ ] Implement database-persistent lockouts
   - [ ] Add user-friendly lockout error messages

2. **Medium Priority**
   - [ ] Add administrative unlock functionality
   - [ ] Implement comprehensive testing
   - [ ] Add monitoring/alerting for security events

3. **Low Priority**
   - [ ] Consider progressive lockout durations (exponential backoff)
   - [ ] Add CAPTCHA after first few failed attempts
   - [ ] Implement IP-based rate limiting

### üöÄ Quick Test Command

To test the current implementation:

```bash
# Make sure your Next.js app is running, then:
node test-account-lockout.js

# Watch your application logs for security events
# Check your database for SecurityEvent entries
```

### üîç Monitoring Queries

To check if account locking is working:

```sql
-- Check recent security events
SELECT type, severity, details, timestamp 
FROM security_events 
WHERE type IN ('BRUTE_FORCE_ATTEMPT', 'SUSPICIOUS_LOGIN')
ORDER BY timestamp DESC 
LIMIT 20;

-- Check for any blocked IPs
SELECT ip, reason, blocked_at, expires_at 
FROM blocked_ips 
WHERE is_active = true;
```

## Conclusion

The account lockout functionality is **partially implemented** with the core logic in place, but has **critical limitations** due to in-memory storage. While it will work for basic scenarios, it needs significant improvements for production reliability, especially in cloud/serverless environments.

**Risk Level: MEDIUM** - The functionality exists but may not persist across server restarts, reducing its security effectiveness.
