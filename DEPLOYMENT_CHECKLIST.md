## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Final Environment Setup
```bash
# Ensure production environment variables are set
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL="your-production-db-url"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-production-secret"
CRYPTOMUS_API_KEY="your-production-api-key"
```

### 2. Database Preparation
```bash
# Apply final schema changes
npx prisma db push

# Generate Prisma client with new types
npx prisma generate

# Verify security tables
npx tsx scripts/security-migration.ts
```

### 3. Application Deployment
```bash
# Build production application
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification
```bash
# Run security migration script
npx tsx scripts/security-migration.ts

# Check security dashboard at /dashboard/admin-security
# Verify IP blocking functionality
# Test rate limiting on APIs
```

## 📊 Production Monitoring

### Real-time Security Dashboard
- **URL**: `/dashboard/admin-security`
- **Features**: Live security events, IP management, threat analytics
- **Updates**: Every 30 seconds
- **Access**: Admin users only

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Security Events**: Total count and recent activity
- **Blocked IPs**: Active blocks and automatic scoring
- **Threat Distribution**: Severity levels and attack types
- **System Performance**: Database queries and response times

## 🔧 Maintenance Tasks

### Daily
- [ ] Check security dashboard for unusual activity
- [ ] Review blocked IPs and verify legitimacy
- [ ] Monitor system performance metrics

### Weekly
- [ ] Run security migration script for cleanup
- [ ] Review security event patterns
- [ ] Update threat detection rules if needed

### Monthly
- [ ] Full security audit and penetration testing
- [ ] Review and update security configurations
- [ ] Backup security data and configurations

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

### Database (Enhanced)
- **Prisma ORM**: Type-safe queries with automatic optimization
- **Indexed Tables**: Fast queries on timestamp, IP, severity
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connections
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Prevents table bloat

### Caching
- **IP Block Cache**: 5-minute in-memory cache
- **Security Stats**: Cached for optimal dashboard performance
- **Rate Limiting**: Memory-efficient sliding windows

### Scaling
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Database-backed storage supports multiple instances
- **Load Balancing**: Stateless security monitor design
- **Read Replicas**: Can use database replicas for analytics

## 🚨 Incident Response

### Automatic Responses
1. **High-Risk Events**: Logged with severity scoring
2. **IP Blocking**: Automatic blocks for threat score ≥ 75
3. **Rate Limiting**: Immediate throttling for abuse
4. **Admin Alerts**: Dashboard notifications for critical events

### Manual Response Procedures
1. **Access Security Dashboard**: Monitor real-time events
2. **Investigate Anomalies**: Check event details and patterns
3. **Block Malicious IPs**: Use admin interface for immediate blocking
4. **Update Security Rules**: Modify detection patterns as needed

## 📈 Security Metrics
